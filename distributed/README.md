# Distributed Systems

* Perceived latency: service time and queueing
* Request rate
* Error rate
* Traffic origins
* Histogram of latencies for each server, for comparisons
* Visualizations:
  * heatmaps
    * for service
    * per server
    * per backend
  * system 'flame graph'
  * visualize traffic as graph, queue time, request flow
